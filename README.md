# Clustering on the Iris Dataset

This project applies two clustering techniques, KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering, to the Iris dataset from the `sklearn` library. The goal is to group the data into clusters based on the features of the Iris flowers.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to evaluate clustering techniques by applying them to the Iris dataset. The key steps include:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Load the Iris dataset.
   - Perform feature scaling.

2. **Clustering Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Implement and visualize KMeans Clustering.
   - Implement and visualize Hierarchical Clustering.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset contains measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three species:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

Each flower is described by four features:
- **Sepal Length** (cm)
- **Sepal Width** (cm)
- **Petal Length** (cm)
- **Petal Width** (cm)

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Number of instances**: 150
- **Number of features**: 4
- **Target variable**: Species (not used in clustering)

# Methodology

## Preprocessing
### Feature Scaling:
- Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- This is necessary for clustering algorithms to treat all features equally.

## Clustering Algorithms
### KMeans Clustering:
- Partitions the data into `k` clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
- Suitable for datasets with well-defined, spherical clusters.

### Hierarchical Clustering:
- Builds a hierarchy of clusters using a bottom-up (agglomerative) approach.
- Suitable for datasets where the number of clusters is not known in advance.

## Results
### KMeans Clustering
- Applied KMeans clustering with `k=3` (since there are 3 species in the Iris dataset).
- Visualized the clusters using the first two features (scaled).

### Hierarchical Clustering
- Applied Hierarchical clustering using the Ward method.
- Visualized the dendrogram to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Cut the dendrogram to obtain 3 clusters and visualized the results.

## Conclusion
### KMeans Clustering:
- Produced well-defined clusters that align with the structure of the Iris dataset.
- Suitable for this dataset due to its simplicity and efficiency.

### Hierarchical Clustering:
- Provided a hierarchical structure of clusters, which is useful for understanding relationships between data points.
- Suitable for this dataset as it does not require the number of clusters to be specified in advance.
